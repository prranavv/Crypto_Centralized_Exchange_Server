# Cryptocurrency Trading System Design Decisions

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design decisions for a cryptocurrency trading system, explaining how technical choices address the unique challenges of digital asset markets: 24/7 operation, extreme volatility, fragmented liquidity, and the absence of traditional market makers.

## 1. Order Matching Algorithm: Price-Time Priority

### Decision
Implemented strict price-time priority (FIFO at each price level) using BTreeMap for price levels and VecDeque for time ordering.

### Crypto Market Rationale
While traditional exchanges use various matching algorithms, price-time priority is optimal for crypto because:
- **Transparency for Retail Traders**: Crypto markets are retail-dominated; simple, predictable matching builds trust
- **MEV Resistance**: Clear ordering rules reduce opportunities for maximal extractable value (MEV) manipulation
- **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage**: Predictable execution enables arbitrageurs who provide price convergence across fragmented markets
- **DeFi Compatibility**: Aligns with automated market maker (AMM) principles of deterministic execution

### Impact on Crypto Trading
- **Arbitrage Bots**: Can calculate exact execution probability for cross-exchange strategies
- **Liquidation Engines**: DeFi protocols can predictably close underwater positions
- **Market Makers**: Can maintain multiple orders across price levels without complex priority rules

## 2. Decimal Precision for Monetary Values

### Decision
Used `rust_decimal` library for all price and quantity calculations.

### Crypto-Specific Requirements
Cryptocurrency precision requirements are extreme:
- **Bitcoin**: 8 decimal places (satoshis)
- **Ethereum**: 18 decimal places (wei)
- **Stablecoins**: Often 6-18 decimals
- **Cross-Rate Calculation**: BTC/ETH requires precise handling of both assets' decimals

### DeFi Integration Considerations
- **Smart Contract Compatibility**: Must match on-chain precision to prevent rounding attacks
- **Flash Loan Arbitrage**: Even 1 wei discrepancy can break flash loan profitability
- **Impermanent Loss Calculations**: AMM integration requires exact decimal math

### Real Example
A trader arbitraging between Uniswap and this exchange:
```
Uniswap BTC/USDC: 50,123.456789 USDC
Our Exchange: 50,123.456788 USDC
Profit per BTC: 0.000001 USDC (must be precisely calculated)
```

## 3. In-Memory Order Book with No Persistence

### Decision
Maintain all state in memory without database persistence.

### Crypto Market Rationale
Cryptocurrency markets demand ultra-low latency because:
- **Global Competition**: Competing with exchanges worldwide, not just regional
- **API Trading Dominance**: 90%+ volume from bots requiring <10ms latency
- **MEV Competition**: Microseconds matter for sandwich attacks and arbitrage
- **No Trading Halts**: 24/7 markets mean no maintenance windows

### Risk Acceptance in Crypto
Unlike traditional finance, crypto traders accept different risks:
- **"Code is Law"**: Traders accept technical risks as part of the ecosystem
- **Self-Custody**: Users maintain their own transaction history
- **Blockchain as Backup**: Final settlement on-chain provides ultimate record

## 4. Multi-Market Architecture for Trading Pairs

### Decision
HashMap of independent order books per trading pair.

### Crypto Market Structure
Essential for cryptocurrency's unique market structure:
- **Infinite Pairs**: Any ERC-20 can trade against any other
- **Stablecoin Varieties**: USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD all trade differently
- **Wrapped Assets**: wBTC, renBTC, BTCB need separate markets
- **Chain-Specific Markets**: ETH on Ethereum vs. ETH on Polygon

### Cross-Chain Considerations
```
BTC/USDT (Native Bitcoin)
WBTC/USDT (Wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum)  
BTCB/USDT (Bitcoin on Binance Chain)
```
Each requires separate order books despite representing "the same" asset.

## 5. Market Order Execution Against Full Depth

### Decision
Market orders execute against entire available depth with average price calculation.

### Crypto Volatility Management
Cryptocurrency's extreme volatility requires different approach:
- **Flash Crashes Common**: 10-20% moves in minutes are normal
- **Thin Liquidity**: Many altcoins have sparse order books
- **Whale Trades**: Single large orders can move markets significantly
- **No Circuit Breakers**: Unlike traditional markets, crypto trades 24/7 without halts

### Liquidation Cascade Protection
During market stress (like Terra/Luna collapse):
- Cascading liquidations create massive market orders
- System must handle extreme order book imbalances
- Average price calculation helps traders understand execution cost

## 6. Synchronous Order Processing

### Decision
Process orders synchronously with mutex-protected state.

### Blockchain Alignment
Synchronous processing mirrors blockchain consensus:
- **Block Time Analogy**: Like Bitcoin's 10-minute blocks, batching is acceptable
- **Fairness Over Speed**: Prevents front-running that plagues DEXs
- **Gas War Prevention**: Avoids priority gas auction (PGA) dynamics
- **Mempool Ordering**: Similar to first-seen transaction ordering

### MEV Mitigation
Reduces extractable value opportunities:
- No privileged order flow access
- No reordering possibilities
- No sandwich attack vectors within our system

## 7. Partial Fill Support with Exact Tracking

### Decision
Track original and filled quantities for all orders.

### DeFi Protocol Integration
Critical for integration with DeFi protocols:
- **Limit Order Protocols**: 0x, 1inch Limit Orders need partial fill tracking
- **TWAP Strategies**: Algorithmic traders split large orders
- **Dollar Cost Averaging**: Retail users accumulate positions over time
- **Liquidity Mining**: Rewards often based on filled volume

### Whale Order Management
Large crypto holders ("whales") require sophisticated execution:
```
Order: Buy 1000 BTC
- Fill 100 BTC at $50,000
- Fill 200 BTC at $50,100  
- Fill 700 BTC at $50,200
Average Price: $50,133.33
```

## 8. No Trading Fees in Core Engine

### Decision
Order matching engine operates without fee logic.

### Crypto Fee Innovation
Allows flexibility for crypto-specific fee models:
- **Mining Fee Mining**: Users earn tokens for paying fees
- **Token Burns**: Fees destroyed rather than collected
- **Negative Fees**: Maker rebates common in crypto
- **Dynamic Fees**: Based on network congestion or volatility
- **Governance Token Discounts**: Holding exchange tokens reduces fees

### Layer 2 Integration
Fee abstraction enables:
- Lightning Network integration (off-chain Bitcoin)
- Polygon/Arbitrum deployment (different gas models)
- Cross-chain bridges with varying fee structures

## 9. Simple Error Types Without Complex Validation

### Decision
Basic error handling without extensive business rule validation.

### Crypto Market Philosophy
Aligns with cryptocurrency's permissionless ethos:
- **Minimal Restrictions**: No accredited investor checks
- **Global Access**: No geographic or time restrictions
- **Pseudonymous Trading**: No KYC at protocol level
- **Censorship Resistance**: Cannot block specific addresses

### Smart Contract Compatibility
Simple errors work better with smart contracts:
- Solidity requires simple revert reasons
- Gas optimization favors minimal validation
- On-chain verification handles complex rules

## 10. Real-time Market Depth Visibility

### Decision
Full order book depth available via API.

### Transparency in Crypto
Complete transparency is expected in crypto:
- **No Hidden Orders**: Unlike traditional dark pools
- **On-Chain Verification**: Users can verify order book matches claimed liquidity
- **DEX Competition**: Competing with fully transparent AMMs
- **Composability**: Other protocols need full visibility to integrate

### Arbitrage Efficiency
Full depth enables:
- Cross-exchange arbitrage bots
- DEX aggregator integration
- Flashloan opportunity calculation
- Statistical arbitrage strategies

## Cryptocurrency-Specific Considerations

### 24/7 Operation
Design supports continuous operation:
- No daily settlement cycles
- No maintenance windows
- Instant order processing
- Global accessibility

### Token Diversity
System handles any token pair:
- No preset tick sizes (each token different)
- Variable decimal places
- No minimum order sizes
- Any base/quote combination

### DeFi Composability
Architecture enables DeFi integration:
```rust
// Future: Smart contract can place orders
// Future: Flash loans can access liquidity
// Future: Yield aggregators can provide liquidity
```

### MEV and Front-running Protection
Current design mitigates common attacks:
- No mempool visibility
- Deterministic ordering
- No privileged access
- Time-priority prevents queue jumping
